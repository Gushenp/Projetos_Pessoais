### [Cine Verde](#cine-verde)
**Cine Verde** is a movie catalog website that allows users to create personalized movie lists, filter films by release date, and explore their favorite movies in a more organized and visually appealing way. The project aims to provide a simple but functional interface to manage a collection of movies, enabling users to browse, search, and filter movies easily.

This project uses the Fetch API to retrieve data from an external movie API and stores movie information in Local Storage for persistence across sessions. The website also features a responsive design, making it accessible across different devices. Users can filter movies by their release date and sort them to quickly find the films they are most interested in.
